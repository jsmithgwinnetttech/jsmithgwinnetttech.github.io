    <p>Welcome to Little Paws Sanctuary, our mission is to inspire kitten rescue and adoption by sharing resources, stories, and ways to help.</p> 

    <p>If you’re interested in adopting a kitten, our shelter is here to connect you with the right match. We provide medical care, vaccinations, and socialization to ensure each kitten is healthy and ready for a new home. Our facility also offers resources on adoption, kitten care, and responsible pet ownership to support you every step of the way.</p>    
    
    <p>We offer a one-week foster trial so you can experience the joy of having a kitten in your home before making a commitment. During this time, you’ll see their personalities shine, learn about their care, and discover how rewarding adoption can be. Contact us today to start your foster-to-adopt trial and help give a kitten a forever home!</p>
